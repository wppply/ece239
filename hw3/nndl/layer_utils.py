This code was originally written for CS 231n at Stanford University
(cs231n.stanford.edu).  It has been modified in various areas for use in the
ECE 239AS class at UCLA.  This includes the descriptions of what code to
implement as well as some slight potential changes in variable names to be
consistent with class nomenclature.  We thank Justin Johnson & Serena Yeung for
